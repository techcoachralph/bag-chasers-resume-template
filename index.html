                <h3>Highlights & Objectives</h3>
                <p>I am a customer-driven, results-oriented Lead QA Engineer who is dedicated to contributing and enhancing the software development process. I specialize in taking complex testing situations and working through them to offer my team solutions to enhance our testing capabilities. I have engineered solutions to increase the speed of testing through various Selenium grids (AWS Device Farm, SauceLabs, BrowserStack) as well as built custom testing platforms via Docker images. In addition, I take great pleasure and pride contributing to tools to provide QA testing metrics to the organization. However, that does not take away from always having the heart, mind, and eye of the customer to understand requirements through their eyes and leave a strong QA fingerprint on the software development process by working with the developers early to understand the QA process to reduce the changes of bugs during development and go to market earlier and faster.</p>
