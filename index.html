            <h3>Highlights & Objectives</h3>
            <p>I am a customer-driven, results-oriented Lead QA Engineer who is dedicated to contributing and enhancing the software development process. I specialize in taking complex testing situations and working through them to offer my team solutions to enhance our testing capabilities. I have engineered solutions to increase the speed of testing through various Selenium grids (AWS Device Farm, SauceLabs, BrowserStack) as well as built custom testing platforms via Docker images. In addition, I take great pleasure and pride contributing to tools to provide QA testing metrics to the organization. However, that does not take away from always having the heart, mind, and eye of the customer to understand requirements through their eyes and leave a strong QA fingerprint on the software development process by working with the developers early to understand the QA process to reduce the changes of bugs during development and go to market earlier and faster.</p>

                                    <p>Using Terraform, I orchestrated the seamless setup of an EC2 instance on AWS. The process began with defining infrastructure as code, specifying instance types, security groups, and networking configurations. Once the EC2 instance was provisioned, I employed Terraform's capabilities to automate the installation of Docker and Docker Compose, streamlining the containerization of applications. After Docker was up and running, I orchestrated the deployment of a Selenium Grid, enabling distributed testing capabilities for web applications. By leveraging Terraform's automation and AWS's cloud infrastructure, this approach ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficiency in managing the Selenium Grid for comprehensive and robust web testing.</p>

                                    <p>In tackling a code challenge, I harnessed the power of Python and its libraries to extract metadata from an MP3 file.

I then compared this extracted metadata against expected results, ensuring accuracy and validity. This efficient Python-based solution not only validated the MP3 file's metadata but also demonstrated the flexibility and versatility of Python in handling complex data processing tasks.</p>
