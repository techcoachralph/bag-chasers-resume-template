# bag-chasers-resume-template
This is the html project for recreating Anton Daniels' resume template

The initial livestream where we created the wireframe in Figma and went through the step by step process of creating the HTML and apply the CSS positioning can be found here.

If you need an editor, I personally use WebStorm by JetBrains but many people use VSCode by Microsoft
